# ACME Cedar Example

This repository contains the Cedar schema, policies, and entity definitions used in the demonstration of how LLMs can be used to author Cedar policies. The examples follow the ACME **Customer Collaboration platform** scenario from the book *Authorization in Digital Identity*. The example demonstrates how a fictional company, ACME Corp, uses Cedar to model fine-grained access control for employees and customers collaborating on shared documents.

See `ai/cursor/README` for additional info on how to use Cursor to help author Cedar policies. 

The schema, entities, and policies used in this repository are from the [ACME Cedar Demo repository](https://github.com/windley/acme-cedar-demo).
